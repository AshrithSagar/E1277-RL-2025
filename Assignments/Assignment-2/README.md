# Assignment-2

1. Please neatly write down the answers on blank sheets of paper.
   It is recommended that you write down the answer to each question on a new page.
   Once you are done, you will need to scan the answer sheets into a pdf.

2. This pdf will then need to be uploaded to gradescope and you will be simultaneously asked to mark the pages where the solution to each question begins and ends.
   The instructions for submitting your HW can be found here: <https://gradescope-static-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/help/submitting_hw_guide.pdf>.

3. Only a subset of the questions would be graded.
   However, you won't be informed a priori which questions will be graded.
   Hence, you need to solve all the given questions.

4. You are free to use the textbook or the discussions available on the Internet.
   However, you are expected to write down the answers in your own words.
   Simply writing down the final answer will not get you the full points.
   Instead, you must give explicit reasons for each statement that you make in your submission.
   Your explanation should be good enough to make the TA understand how you arrived at your answer.
   There are marks for partial solutions.

5. Mention all the assumptions you are making.

6. Use a calculator when necessary.

7. Do not cheat.
   Any academic misconduct will be dealt with strictly using all permissible laws of the institute.
