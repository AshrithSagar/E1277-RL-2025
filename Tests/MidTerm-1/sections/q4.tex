\section*{Question 4}

A burglar is successful on each attempt with probability \( p \) and unsuccessful with probability \( 1-p \).
If he is successful, the amount he loots is \( j \) with probability \( P_{j}, j \geq 0 \).
If unsuccessful, he is caught and taken into custody, and loses all his loot (from the start), and the problem ends.
The burglar is allowed to retire at any time and keep all the loot he has accumulated up to that time.
Assume that the expected loot from a successful burglary is finite.
Show that the optimal policy for the burglar is of the threshold type, that is, there exists \( i_{0} \) such that if the loot level \( i \) is at least \( i_{0} \), it is optimal for the burglar to stop.
