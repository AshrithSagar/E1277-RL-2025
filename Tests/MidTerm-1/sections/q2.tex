\section*{Question 2}

Consider a grid world problem involving a \( 4 \times 4 \) grid.
Each cell in the grid world corresponds to a state with \( G \) being the terminal or goal state.
Assume that four actions are feasible in every state, namely ``go up'', ``go down'', ``go right'' and ``go left'', respectively.
Any action that leads the agent to leave the grid results in no change in state and a reward of -1.
(This can happen for states on the boundary of the grid world.)
Other actions move the state one step in the suggested direction (within the grid world) and give a reward of +1.
Suppose actions in every state are chosen according to the equiprobable policy \( \pi \) (that selects each action with equal probability).
The numbers in the table below show the values of the various states.
However, the values \( v_{\pi}(C) \) and \( v_{\pi}(D) \) below for states \( C \) and \( D \) are not known.

    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
        \hline
        0.2 & 0.8              & 0.6     & 0.8              \\
        \hline
        0.8 & 2.6              & 2.8     & 0.7              \\
        \hline
        0.6 & \( v_{\pi}(C) \) & \( G \) & 0.8              \\
        \hline
        0.2 & 0.6              & 0.4     & \( v_{\pi}(D) \) \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}
Find \( v_{\pi}(C) \) and \( v_{\pi}(D) \)?
