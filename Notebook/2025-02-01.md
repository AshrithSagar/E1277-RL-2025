## Proposition-1

### Proposition-1a {#prop-1a}

For a proper policy $\mu$, the associated cost vector $J_\mu$ satisfies
$$
\lim_{k \to \infty} (T\mu^k J)(i) = J_\mu (i), \quad \forall i \in S
$$
for every vector $J \in \mathbb{R}^{\vert S \vert}$. Moreover,
$$
J_\mu = T_\mu J_\mu
\label{eq:unique-fixed-point-eq2}
$$
and $J_\mu$ is the unique solution for this equation $\eqref{eq:unique-fixed-point-eq2}$.

### Proposition-1b {#prop-1b}

A stationary policy $\mu$ satisfying for some vector $J$,
$$
J(i) \geq T_\mu J(i), \quad \forall i \in S
$$
is <u>proper</u>.

~Sufficient condition for a proper policy; Necessary as well;


### Proof

#### Part-(b)

For a stationary policy $\mu$, suppose $\exists J \in \mathbb{R}^n$ [Note: $n$ and $\vert S \vert$ are used interchangeably here], s.t. $J(i) \geq (T_\mu J)(i) \ \forall \ i \in S$.

By monotonicity of $T_\mu$, $(T_\mu J)(i) \geq (T_\mu^2 J)(i)$.

Upon repeating successively,
$$
J(i) \geq (T_\mu J)(i) \geq (T_\mu^2 J)(i) \geq \dots \geq (T_\mu^k J)(i)
\\
= (P_\mu^k J)(i) + \left( \sum_{m=0}^{k-1} P_\mu^m g_\mu \right) (i)
$$
If $\mu$ were not proper, then by assumption (B), $\exists \ i \in S$, s.t. $J_\mu (i) = \infty$.

This is a contradiction since
$$
\lim_{k \to \infty} \left( \sum_{m=0}^{k} P_\mu^m g_\mu \right) (i) = J_\mu (i)
$$
But $J(i) < \infty \ \forall \ i \in S$

## Proposition-2

**(a).** The optimal cost vector $J^*$ satisfies
$$
J^* = T J^*
\tag{Bellman equation}
$$
Moreover, $J^*$ is the unique solution to that above equation.

**(b).** We have $\lim_{k \to \infty} (T^k J) (i) = J^* (i), \ \forall \ i \in S$ ad for any $J \in \mathbb{R}^{\vert S \vert}$

**(c).** A stationary policy $\mu$ is optimal if and only if $T_\mu J^* = T J^*$

### Proof-(a),(b)

We first show that $T$ has atmost one fixed point.

~Through proof by contradiction

Suppose $J$ and $J'$ are two fixed points of $T$. We select policies $\mu$ and $\mu'$ s.t.

$$
\begin{aligned}
J &= TJ = T_\mu J \quad \text{and}
\\
J' &= TJ' = T_{\mu'} J'
\end{aligned}
$$
**Note:**
$$
(TJ) (i) = \min _{u \in A(i)} \sum_{j \in S} P_{ij}(u) \Big( g(i, u, j) + J(j) \Big) \ \forall \ i \in S
$$
Suppose for $i \longrightarrow$ minimising action is $u_i \triangleq \mu(i)$

Map states to the policy ($\mu$): $i \longleftrightarrow \mu(i), \ \forall \ i \in S$

$$
\implies
(TJ) (i) = \sum_{j \in S} P_{ij}(\mu(i)) \Big( g(i, \mu(i), j) + J(j) \Big) = (T_\mu J) (i)
$$
Thus, $J = T_\mu J$ and $J' = T_{\mu'} J' \implies \mu \text{ \& } \mu'$ are proper policies, by [proposition-1b](#prop-1b).

By proposition-1a, $J = J_\mu$ and $J' = J_{\mu'}$.

Now, $J = TJ = T^2 J = \dots = T^k J \leq T_{\mu'}^k J$

$T^k J \leq T_{\mu'}^k J$ is true since $T^k$ involves a minimisation step while $T_{\mu'}^k$ involves evaluating on a policy $\mu'$

Analogy: $X = \{  x_1, x_2, x_3 \} \implies \min_{x \in X} f(x) \leq f(x_1)$

It then follows that

$$
J \leq \lim_{k \to \infty} T_{\mu'}^k J = J_{\mu'} = J'
$$
~But $J \text{ \& } J'$ were arbitrary, so

Similarly $J' \leq J \implies J = J' \implies T$ has atmost one fixed point

---

We now show that $T$ has atleast one fixed point

Let $\mu$ be a proper policy. By assumption-A, $\exists$ atleast one proper policy.

Let $\mu'$ be another policy s.t. $T_{\mu'} J_{\mu} = T J_{\mu}$.

Then, $J_\mu = T_\mu J_\mu \geq T J_\mu = T_{\mu'} J_{\mu}$

$\implies J_\mu = T_{\mu'} J_{\mu} \implies \mu'$ is proper by proposition-1b.

Then,

$$
J_\mu \geq T_{\mu'} J_{\mu} \geq T_{\mu'}^2 J_{\mu} \geq \dots \geq \lim_{k \to \infty} T_{\mu'}^k J_{\mu} = J_{\mu'}
$$
$\implies J_\mu \geq J_{\mu'}$

Continuing in this manner, we obtain a sequence $\{ \mu^k \}$ s.t. each point $\mu^k$ is proper and

$$
J_{\mu^k} = T_{\mu^k} J_{\mu^k} \geq T J_{\mu^k} =  T_{\mu^{k+1}} J_{\mu^k} \geq T_{\mu^{k+1}}^2 J_{\mu^k} \geq \dots \lim_{n \to \infty} T_{\mu^{k+1}}^n J_{\mu^k} = J_{\mu^{k+1}}
$$
Thus, $J_{\mu^k} \geq T_{\mu^{k+1}} J_{\mu^k} \geq J_{\mu^{k+1}} \ \forall \ k$, where $T_{\mu^{k+1}} J_{\mu^k} = T J_{\mu^k}$.

However, one cannot continue to improve on $J_{\mu^k}$ forever, and so there will exist a policy $\mu$ s.t.

$$
J_\mu \geq T J_\mu \geq J_\mu
$$
(Since the number of stationary policies is finite)
$$
\implies J_\mu = T J_\mu
$$
Thus, $J_\mu$ is a fixed point of $T$ and it has to be unique.

**Note:** This policy has to be proper as well. $J_\mu = T_\mu J_\mu$

---

Next, we show that $J_\mu = J^*$ and $T^k J \longrightarrow J^*$ as $k \to \infty$

Let $e = \underbrace{(1, 1, \dots, 1)}_{n}$ and $\delta > 0$ is a scalar and $\hat J$ be the vector satisfying $T_\mu \widehat J = \widehat J - \delta e$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\implies
\widehat J
& =
T_\mu \widehat J + \delta e
= g_\mu + \delta e + P_\mu \widehat J
\\ &
\text{With }
g_\mu' \triangleq g_\mu + \delta e
\\
\implies
\widehat J
& =
g_\mu' + P_\mu \widehat J
\end{aligned}
$$
$\implies \widehat J$ is the cost vector corresponding to the policy $\mu$ with $g_\mu$ replaced with $g_{\mu} + \delta e$

Moreover, $J_\mu \leq \widehat J$

$$
\implies
J_\mu = T J_\mu \leq T \widehat J \leq T_\mu \widehat J = \widehat J - \delta e \leq \widehat J
\\
\vdots
\\
\implies
J_\mu = T^k J_\mu \leq T^k \widehat J \leq T^{k-1} \widehat J \leq \widehat J
\\
\because T \widehat J \leq \widehat J
$$
Thus, $T^k \widehat J, \ k \geq 1$ is a bounded monotone sequence and $T^k \widehat J \to \widetilde J$ as $k \to \infty$ for some $\widetilde J$ s.t.

$$
T \widetilde J = T \left( \lim_{k \to \infty} T^k \widetilde J \right) = \lim_{k \to \infty} T^{k+1} \widehat J = \widetilde J
$$
$\implies \widetilde J = J_\mu$, since $J_\mu$ is the unique fixed point of $T$

~convergence to some value, since (lower) bounded monotone and diminishing.

Further,

$$
J_\mu - \delta e = T J_\mu - \delta e \leq T (J_\mu - \delta e) \leq T J_\mu
$$
Recall
$$
T (J + r e) \leq TJ + re, \text{ if } r > 0
\\
T (J + r e) \geq TJ + re, \text{ if } r < 0
$$

$$
\implies
T (J_\mu - \delta e) \leq T^2 (J_\mu - \delta e) = J_\mu
$$

Thus, $T^k (J_\mu - \delta e)$ is monotonically increasing and bounded above

Also,

$$
\lim_{k \to \infty} T^k (J_\mu - \delta e) = J_\mu
$$
For any $J \in \mathbb{R}^n$, we can find $\delta > 0$ s.t.

$$
J_\mu - \delta e \leq J \leq \widehat J
$$
Recall $\widehat J$ is the cost vector for policy $\mu$ with single stage costs $g_\mu + \delta e$

By monotonicity of $T$,

$$
T^k (J_\mu - \delta e) \leq T^k J \leq T^k \widehat J \quad \forall \ k \geq 1
$$
Also,

$$
J_\mu = \lim_{k \to \infty} T^k (J_\mu - \delta e) \leq \lim_{k \to \infty} T^k J \leq \lim_{k \to \infty} T^k \widehat J = J_\mu
$$
To show that $J_\mu = J^*$, take any policy $\pi = \{ \mu_0, \mu_1, \mu_2, \dots \}$. Then

$$
T_{\mu_0} T_{\mu_1} \cdots T_{\mu_{k-1}} J_0 \geq T^k J_0
$$
where $J_0$ is an arbitrary vector

Taking $\limsup$ as $k \to \infty$ on both sides, we obtain $J_\pi \geq J_\mu$

Since $\pi$ is arbitrary, $\mu$ is optimal and $J_\mu = J^*$

### Proof-(c)

If $\mu$ is optimal, then $J_\mu = J^*$. By assumptions A & B, $\mu$ is proper.

By proposition-1a,

$$
T_\mu J^* = T_\mu J_\mu = J_\mu = J^* = T J^*
\\
\implies
T_\mu J^* = T J^*
$$
Conversely, suppose $T_\mu J^* = T J^*$. Then since $\mu$ is proper, we have that $J^* = J_\mu$ since $J^* = T_\mu J^* \quad \big( = T J^* \big)$ and $\exists$ a unique solution $J_\mu$ to the above equation.
