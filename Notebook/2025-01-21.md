## Stochastic shortest path problems

- a.k.a Episodic problems

- Characterised by the existance of a goal/terminal state
  - Goal/terminal state: $0$
  - Non-terminal state: $1, 2, \dots, n$

- Goal/terminal state: $0$

$$
g(0, u, 0) = 0, \quad \forall u \in A(0)
\\
P_{00}(u) = 1, \quad \forall u \in A(0)
$$

  - Assumed to have no terminal cost

### Definitions

- Proper policy ($\mu$)

  - If the following is satisfied

$$
\rho_\mu \triangleq  \max _{i = 1, 2, \dots, n} P(S_n \neq 0 \mid S_0 = i, \mu) < 1
$$

- Improper policy
