\section*{Question 2}

Suppose we have a machine that is either running or is broken down.
If it runs throughout one week, it makes a gross profit of \$100.
If it fails during the week, gross profit is zero.
If it is running at the start of the week and we perform preventive maintenance, the probability that it will fail during the week is 0.4.
If we do not perform such maintenance, the probability of failure is 0.7.
However, maintenance will cost \$20.
When the machine is broken down at the start of the week, it may either be repaired at a cost of \$40, in which case it will fail during the week with a probability of 0.4, or it may be replaced at a cost of \$150 by a new machine that is guaranteed to run through its first week of operation.
Find the optimal repair, replacement, and maintenance policy that maximizes total profit over four weeks, assuming a new machine at the start of the first week (that is guaranteed to run during the first week of operation).
