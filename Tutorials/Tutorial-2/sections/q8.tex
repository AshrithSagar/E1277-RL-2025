\section*{Question 8}

Which one of them is a complete metric space?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep, nolistsep, label= (\alph*)]
    \item \( \{ 0,1 \} \)
    \item \( ( 0,1 ] \ \) (Metric is Euclidean distance)
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Solution}

A metric space is said to be complete if every Cauchy sequence in the metric space converges to a point in the metric space.

\subsubsection*{Metric Space \( \{ 0,1 \} \)}

The only possible Cauchy sequences in this metric space are the constant sequences \( 0, 0, 0, \dots \) and \( 1, 1, 1, \dots \), which converge to \( 0 \) and \( 1 \) respectively, both of which are in the metric space, and hence the metric space is complete.

\subsubsection*{Metric Space \( ( 0,1 ] \)}

Consider the sequence \( a_n = 1/n \), which is a Cauchy sequence in the metric space \( ( 0,1 ] \), as seen in the previous question.
The sequence converges to zero, which is not in the metric space, and hence the metric space is not complete.
