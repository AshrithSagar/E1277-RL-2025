\section*{Question 9}\label{sec:q9}

Give an example of a contraction function/mapping such that no fixed point exists. \\
(Hint: Consider \( (0,1] \) as domain and codomain).

\subsection*{Solution}

Consider the function \( f: (0,1] \to (0,1] \) defined by \( f(x) = \alpha x \) where \( 0 < \alpha < 1 \), i.e., with the domain and codomain as \( (0,1] \).
We can see that this function is a contraction mapping, as for any \( x, y \in (0,1] \), we have
\[
    \vert f(x) - f(y) \vert = \left\vert \alpha x - \alpha y \right\vert = \alpha \vert x - y \vert
\]
i.e., the contraction factor is \( \alpha \), which by choice is \( < 1 \), satisfying the contraction condition.

To show that no fixed point exists for this function, we proceed through proof by contradiction.
Assume that there exists a fixed point \( x^* \), i.e., \( f(x^*) = x^* \).
Then, we have
\[
    x^* = f(x^*) = \alpha x^*
\]
which implies that \( x^* = 0 \ \because \alpha \neq 0 \).
But \( x^* \in (0,1] \), which is a contradiction.
Hence, no fixed point exists for the contraction mapping \( f(x) = \alpha x \) defined on the domain \( (0,1] \).
