\section*{Question 9}\label{sec:q9}

Give an example of a contraction function/mapping such that no fixed point exists. \\
(Hint: Consider \( (0,1] \) as domain and codomain).

\subsection*{Solution}

Consider the function \( f: (0,1] \to (0,1] \) defined by \( f(x) = x/2 \), i.e., with the domain and codomain as \( (0,1] \).
We can see that this function is a contraction mapping, as for any \( x, y \in (0,1] \), we have
\[
    \vert f(x) - f(y) \vert = \left\vert \frac{x}{2} - \frac{y}{2} \right\vert = \frac{1}{2} \vert x - y \vert
\]
i.e., the contraction factor is \( 1/2 \), which is less than one.

To show that no fixed point exists for this function, we proceed through proof by contradiction.
Assume that there exists a fixed point \( x^* \), i.e., \( f(x^*) = x^* \).
Then, we have
\[
    x^* = f(x^*) = \frac{x^*}{2}
\]
which implies that \( x^* = 0 \), but \( x^* \in (0,1] \), which is a contradiction.
Hence, no fixed point exists for the contraction function/mapping \( f(x) = x/2 \) defined on the domain \( (0,1] \).
