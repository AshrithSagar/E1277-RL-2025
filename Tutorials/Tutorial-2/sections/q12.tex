\section*{Question 12}

Suppose the domain and codomain is \( (0,1] \), Is the fixed point theorem still valid?
If not, then give an example of a continuous function that does not have a fixed point.

\subsection*{Solution}

The fixed point theorem is not valid for a continuous function defined on the domain and codomain \( (0,1] \).
Proof is similar to \hyperref[sec:q9]{Question 9}.
