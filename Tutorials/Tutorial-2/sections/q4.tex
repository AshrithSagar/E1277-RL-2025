\section*{Question 4}

Give an example of a MDP such that even if the policy is improper, the expected total reward is bounded.
(Hint: consider MDP with number of states countably infinite, and for the simplicity assume that there is only one starting state).

\subsection*{Solution}

Consider an MDP with a countably infinite number of states, with a terminal state \( s_0 \) and a starting state \( s_1 \).
Assume a discount factor \( \gamma = 1 \) and a deterministic policy, where the agent moves to the next state in the sequence \( s_1, s_2, \dots \) with a reward of \( 1/2^i \) at state \( s_i \).
This policy is improper as the agent never reaches the terminal state \( s_0 \).
We can see that the total reward for the trajectory \( s_1, s_2, \dots \) is given by
\[
    \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{2^i} = 1
\]
which is a finite value, and thereby the expected total reward is bounded.
Hence, even if the policy is improper, the expected total reward can be bounded for certain MDPs.
