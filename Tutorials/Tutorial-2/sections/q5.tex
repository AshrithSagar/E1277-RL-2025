\section*{Question 5}\label{sec:q5}

Consider an finite state MDP, the discount factor is less than one.
Then, prove that the total reward is bounded for any trajectory.

\subsection*{Solution}

Given a finite state MDP with a discount factor \( \gamma < 1 \), we can prove that the total reward is bounded for any trajectory.
Since the MDP has a finite number of states, we can have a finite number of distinct rewards that we get when making transitions from a state to any other state.
Thereby, we can find the maximum absolute of all rewards, denoted as \( \vert R_{\text{max}} \vert \).
(Note that even in the uncountable case, if the supremum of the rewards exists, we can consider that).
The expected total reward for any trajectory is given by
\[
    R = \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \gamma^t r_t
\]
where \( r_t \) is the reward at time step \( t \).
By triangle inequality, we have
\[
    \vert R \vert \leq \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \gamma^t \vert r_t \vert
\]
and since each reward is bounded by \( \vert R_{\text{max}} \vert \), we get
\[
    \vert R \vert \leq \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \gamma^t \vert R_{\text{max}} \vert
\]
Now, since the discount factor \( \gamma < 1 \), this geometric series converges to
\[
    \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \gamma^t \vert R_{\text{max}} \vert = \frac{R_{\text{max}}}{1 - \gamma}
\]
Hence, proved.
