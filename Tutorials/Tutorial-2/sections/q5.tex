\section*{Question 5}

Consider an finite state MDP, the discount factor is less than one.
Then, prove that the total reward is bounded for any trajectory.

\subsection*{Solution}

Given a finite state MDP with a discount factor \( \gamma < 1 \), we can prove that the total reward is bounded for any trajectory.
Since the MDP is finite, there exists a terminal state \( s_T \) which is reachable from any state in the MDP.\@
The total reward for any trajectory is given by
\[
    R = \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \gamma^t r_t
\]
where \( r_t \) is the reward at time step \( t \).
Since the discount factor \( \gamma < 1 \), the total reward is bounded by
\[
    R \leq \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \gamma^t R_{\text{max}}
\]
where \( R_{\text{max}} \) is the maximum reward that can be obtained in the MDP.\@
Since the sum of the geometric series is bounded by
\[
    \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \gamma^t = \frac{1}{1 - \gamma}, \quad \text{for} \quad \vert \gamma \vert < 1
\]
we can conclude that the total reward is bounded for any trajectory in a finite state MDP with a discount factor less than one, and the bound is given by
\[
    R \leq \frac{R_{\text{max}}}{1 - \gamma}
\]
In constucting the solution above, we have used the fact that for a finite MDP, the rewards are bounded, i.e., there exists a maximum reward \( R_{\text{max}} \) that can be obtained in the MDP.\@
