\section*{Question 3}

Consider an MDP and the policy chosen is improper, the number of states is finite, and rewards are nonrandom positive.
Discount factor is 1.
Prove that the total reward is unbounded for each trajectory.
Assume that there are some transitions with zero rewards and assumption A1 is there, does there exist trajectories for which the total reward is bounded?

\subsection*{Solution}
