\section*{Question 2}

Given an proper policy for a finite state MDP.\@
What is the probability of the set of trajectories for which the total reward is unbounded?

\subsection*{Solution}

Since the policy is proper, we have that the trajectories terminate in the terminal state with probability 1.
Since it is a finite MDP, the expected total reward is bounded, thereby the probability of the set of trajectories for which the total reward is unbounded is 0.
