\section*{Question 2}

Given an improper policy for a finite state MDP.\@
What is the probability of the set of trajectories for which the total reward is unbounded?

\subsection*{Solution}

In an improper policy, there is a possibility that the agent may not reach a terminal state, which can lead to an unbounded reward.
The probability of the set of trajectories for which the total reward is unbounded is 1.
