\section*{Question 6}

Give an example of a MDP (with no terminal state) such that, rewards are positive for each transition, the discount factor is also less than one.
But still, the cost is unbounded. \\
(Hint: the number of states is countably infinite).

\subsection*{Solution}

Consider an MDP with a countably infinite number of states, with no terminal state, a discount factor \( \gamma < 1 \), and positive rewards for each transition.
Assume a deterministic policy, where the agent moves to the next state in the sequence \( s_1, s_2, \dots \) with a reward of \( 1/(\gamma^i c) \) at state \( s_i \), where \( c \) is a constant.
The total reward for the trajectory \( s_1, s_2, \dots \) is given by
\[
    R = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \gamma^i \frac{1}{\gamma^i c} = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{c} \longrightarrow \infty
\]
which is the harmonic series, and is unbounded.

In contrast to the \hyperref[sec:q5]{previous question}, the reward sequence is unbounded here, and thereby the total reward is unbounded as well, even though the discount factor \( \gamma \) is less than one.
