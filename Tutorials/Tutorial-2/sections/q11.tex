\section*{Question 11}\label{sec:q11}

Consider a continuous function \( F: [0,1] \rightarrow [0,1] \).
Prove the fixed point theorem. \\
(Hint: Use Hint-4)

\subsection*{Solution}

Given a continuous function \( F: [0,1] \rightarrow [0,1] \), define the function \( g: [0,1] \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \) as \( g(x) = F(x) - x \).
We can see that \( g \) is continuous, as the difference of two continuous functions is continuous.
Moreover, we have \( g(0) = F(0) - 0 = F(0) \geq 0 \) and \( g(1) = F(1) - 1 \implies g(1) \leq 0 \).
By the intermediate value theorem, there exists a point \( x^* \in [0,1] \) such that \( g(x^*) = 0 \), i.e., \( F(x^*) = x^* \), which implies that \( x^* \) is a fixed point of the function \( F \).
