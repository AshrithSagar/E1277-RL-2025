\section*{Question 1}

Consider a MDP with two states only.
One state is terminal/dead.
The probability of returning to the nonterminal state from nonterminal state is \( 0 \leq p<1 \), and the reward you receive during this transition is \( r \).
The reward for entering into the terminal state from nonterminal state is \( R \).
Find the expected total reward received starting from the nonterminal state.
Can you say something about exptected total reward received starting from nonterminal state, if \( 0 \leq p \leq 1 \)?
(Hint for the later part: Think in terms of boundness of expected total rewards).
